# Lightwater Nexus

### What the hell is Lightwater Nexus?

Nothing much. We're the name of the studio who publishes stuff. You might see our name on things.

### Why?

Basically all of [my](https://github.com/justinoboyle) certificates and dev programs are under this name. So it's sticking.

### What *was* it?

[We had a bunch of random unfinished projects that you can check out if you *really* want to](https://github.com/lightwaternexus-legacy).
